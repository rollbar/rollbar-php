## [3.1.4] - 2022-11-18
This version adds a catch during the serialization process to stop serializaiton
errors from causing reports not to be sent to rollbar.
### Added
* Error catching error during serialization by @stephpy in #576

## [3.1.3] - 2022-05-23
This release patches several bugs.
### Added
* Added Safer `parse_str()` usage by @tanakahisateru in #566
### Fixed
* Fixed comment line number in tests by @matt-h in #563
* Fixed rollbar/rollbar-php-laravel#136 try using `__serialize` when obj
  implements `\Serializable` by @pcoutinho in #567.
* Fixed error suppressor context detection for PHP 8 by @tanakahisateru in #565
* Fixed #571 added `null` check on `$filename` by @danielmorell in #572
* Fixed bug in tests on local machine (mac m1) by @Chris53897 in #568

## [3.1.2] - 2022-03-30
This release is a patch to fix a regression in functionality that was introduced
in v3.0.0.
### Fixed
* Fixed https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php-laravel/issues/134 Person ID not 
  cast to string by @danielmorell in #562

## [3.1.1] - 2022-03-11
This release is a patch to fix a bug in the TraceChain class that was introduced 
in v3.1.0.
### Fixed
* Tracechain must implements ContentInterface to be part of Body. by @stephpy 
  in #560

## [3.1.0] - 2022-03-09
Aside from some needed maintenance and bug fixes, this release resolves some 
issues needed to support PHP 8.1. It also updates our support for `psr/log` to 
v2! The other significant update is the addition of the `transformer` option.

One of the important changes is in what types can be passed to `custom` argument 
in `Rollbar\Rollbar::init()`. Passing in an object or class instance that does 
not implement the new `Rollbar\SerializerInterface` has been deprecated. This 
helps us ensure any custom values in your payload are serializable, and they can 
be sent to Rollbar serves without error.
### Added
- Added transformer option by @danielroehrig in #543
- Allow `psr/log` v2 by @Jean85 in #536
- Added psalm static analysis by @bishopb in #550, and #551
- Added `Rollbar\SerializerInterface` to describe serialization behavior @danielmorell in #558
### Fixed
- Fixed `report_suppressed` isset check by @trsteel88 and @bishopb in #539, and $546.
- Fixed missed cleanup of synthetic member variable by @bishopb in #547
- Fixed possibly null argument by @bishopb in #552
- Fixed deprecation warnings on PHP 8.1 @danielmorell in #558
### Changed
* Update PR template by @bxsx in #549

## [3.0.0] - 2021-06-28
### Changed
- The new configuration option `scrub_safelist` replaces the deprecated
  `scrub_whitelist` configuration option, which is now removed.
- The `check_ignore` configuration option, if defined and containing the name
  of an invocable function, will now catch thrown `\Error` -- division by zero,
  parse and type errors, assertion failures, etc. Before, only thrown `\Exception`
  would be caught.
- In the event the API rejected an occurrence during a `log()` call, and no
  message was available, the new default message reads "message not set": before
  this was misspelled as "mesage not set".
### Fixed
- The performance test suite now runs to completion with assertions on the
  expected run-time performance within GitHub actions. Running these on
  different hardware configurations may not match the expectations, so care
  should be taken to match test platform specifications when reporting
  performance issues.  A future version may provide better direction as to the
  required test platform specifications.

### Added

### Removed

### Added
- Add the `use_error_reporting` option back: [#182](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/182)

  [#192](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/192)

- Correctly reverse frames in a stacktrace: [#211](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/211).
  NOTE: this behaviour is consistent with this library for versions less than 1.0, we consider it a
  bug that the frames were in the wrong order for versions 1.0.0 to 1.1.1. However, this change will
  cause the fingerprints of errors to change and therefore may result in some errors showing up as
  new when in fact they already existed with the stack trace in the opposite order.

### Fixed
- Forgot to bump the version number in the README and in the Notifier configuration.

## [1.0.1] - 2017-05-01
### Changed
- Update notifier to send the correct version number in the payload
### Fixed
- Bug fix related to scrubbing potential query strings

## [1.0.0] - 2017-04-28
Almost everything has been refactored or rewritten. The updated README has all of the current
information on how to use the notifier. This release includes API that is backwards compatible with [0.18.2],
however this is for convenience only and the methods that have changed have been marked deprecated.

## [0.18.2] - 2016-07-05
### Removed
- Removed type hinting from RollbarException

## 0.18.1 [YANKED]
### Added
- Added configuration switch for disabling UTF-8 sanitization

## [0.18.0] - 2016-05-26
### Added
- Added support for checkIgnore function See [#82](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/82)

## [0.17.0] - 2016-04-27
### Changed
- Accidental tag of documentation change. No API change present.

## [0.16.0] - 2016-04-22
### Added
- Added support for reporting errors in Command Line Scripts.
- Added (opt-in) support for capturing line of code and context around that code in stack traces. See [#76](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/76)
- Added Level class with string constants for Level values.
### Fixed
- Fixed the severity level that E_PARSE errors are reproted at. See [#75](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/75)
- Captured \Throwable rather than \Exception if using PHP 7

## [0.15.0] - 2015-07-28
### Changed
- Fix bug where `scrub_fields` were case-sensitive, instead of case-insensitive as the docs say. See [#63](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/63)
- Fix bug where integer 0 keys would always be scrubbed. See [#64](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/64) and [#65](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/65)
- Fix detection of the current URL when the protocol is `https` but no `SERVER_PORT` is set. See [#50](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/50)

## [0.14.0] - 2015-06-22
### Changed
- Fix bug where generated UUIDs could overlap if the application calls `mt_srand()` with a predictable value, and then Rollbar methods are called later. Rollbar now calls `mt_srand()` itself. This shouldn't affect anyone, unless you happen to be relying on the sequence of numbers coming from mt_rand across Rollbar calls.

## [0.13.0] - 2015-06-16
### Changed
- Param scrubbing is now applied to query string params inside the request URL. See [#59](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/59)

## [0.12.1] - 2015-06-04
### Fixed
- `branch` now defaults to null (meaning it will not be set) instead of `master`. This fixes a bug where the Rollbar UI wouldn't use the "default branch" setting because it was being overridden by the value sent by rollbar-php. See [#58](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/58).

## [0.12.0] - 2015-06-03
### Changed
- Param scrubbing now accepts a regex string for the key name. Key names starting with `/` are assumed to be a regex.
- Headers are now scrubbed
- Arrays are recursively scrubbed

## [0.11.2] - 2015-05-27
### Fixed
- Fix issue where fatal E_PARSE errors were not reported. See [#55](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/issues/55)

## [0.11.1] - 2015-05-19
### Added
- Add in dependency for cURL library to warn users if they do not have the cURL extension installed ([#54](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/54))

## [0.11.0] - 2015-04-03
### Added
- Added support for nested exceptions. See [#51](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/51)
### Changed
- Calling report_exception with a non-exception will result in the data being dropped and a message being logged to the Rollbar logger, instead of an empty message being reported
- Exceptions are now sent as `trace_chain`, not trace, so any Custom Grouping Rules in the Rollbar UI will need to be updated to use `body.trace_chain.*.` in place of `body.trace.`

## [0.10.0] - 2015-03-30
### Added
- `report_exception` now accepts args for `extra_data` and `payload_data`, providing full access to the Rollbar API. See [#47](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/47)
- Added a unit test suite running on Travis CI (running for PHP 5.3 and higher)
### Fixed
- Fix a json_encode warning with utf8 request param keys. See [#42](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/42)
### Changed
- Moved `rollbar.php` inside `src/`

## [0.9.12] - 2015-03-06
### Fixed
- Fix PHP less than 5.4 compatibility. (Regression added in [0.9.11])

## [0.9.11] - 2015-03-02
### Added
- Added proxy support. ([#44](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/44))

## [0.9.10] - 2015-02-11
### Added
- Add ability to send fingerprint, title, and other advanced payload options in `Rollbar::report_message()`.

## [0.9.9] - 2014-09-11
### Fixed
- Fix an error caused when `report_exception` is called with a non-object (e.g. `null`).

## [0.9.8] - 2014-08-28
### Fixed
- Fixes a bug where `iconv()` will sometimes throw an error, (#36).

## [0.9.7] - 2014-07-30
### Changed
- Force cURL to use IPV4 (`CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE_V4`) if supported ([#35](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/35))

## [0.9.6] - 2014-07-08
### Changed
- No longer have `error_reporting()` prevent simple log message reports ([#33](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/33))

## 0.9.5 [YANKED]
### Added
- Only define `ROLLBAR_INCLUDED_ERRNO_BITMASK` once to prevent warnings and test framework breakages ([#32](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/32))

## [0.9.4] - 2014-06-24
### Added
- New `use_error_reporting` flag that when enabled will respect the current `error_reporting()` level when deciding to report an error ([#29](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/29))
- Access token no longer required if using the agent handler

## [0.9.3] - 2014-06-05
### Changed
- Walk payloads to ensure strings are correctly utf-8 encoded for json encoding

## 0.9.2 [YANKED]
### Added
- Append timestamp (in milliseconds) to agent log file names, to prevent collisions.

## [0.9.1] - 2014-05-29
### Added
- Lazy create the agent log file ([#22](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/22))

## [0.9.0] - 2014-05-23
### Added
- Added `included_errno`, which allows specifying which set of error levels to send to Rollbar (instead of everything below a certain level). This replaces `max_errno`.
- Added a performance optimization which sends the access token as a header.
### Changed
- Changed the default settings to no longer send E_NOTICE errors.
### Removed
- Removed the `max_errno` configuration option.

## [0.8.1] - 2014-04-29
### Added
- Added support for more seamless configuration on Heroku

## [0.8.0] - 2014-04-14
### Added
- Added ability to disable the notifier's fatal error handler ([#18](https://github.com/rollbar/rollbar-php/pull/18))

## [0.7.0] - 2014-03-17
### Fixed
- Fix regression introduced in [0.5.6] which would prevent the default php error handler from running, resulting in scripts no longer halting after such errors.

## [0.6.4] - 2014-03-13
### Changed
- Composer package definition optimizations
- Use subclass for Ratchetio backwards-compatibility layer instead of a `class_alias`

## [0.6.3] - 2014-03-05
### Fixed
- Fix issue where POST params could get clobbered while scrubbing
### Changed
- Convert internal methods from `private` to `protected` for better extensibility

## [0.6.2] - 2014-02-04
### Added
- Adding "pass" to default scrub fields

## [0.6.1] - 2014-02-03
### Fixed
- Respect `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_` http headers for request url construction

## [0.6.0] - 2014-01-20
### Changed
- Don't report errors suppressed with '@' by default

## 0.5.6 [YANKED]
### Added
- A UUID is now generated and sent with each item

## 0.5.5 [YANKED]
### Added
- Added `code_version` configuration setting

## 0.5.4 [YANKED]
### Fixed
- Fix E_WARNING when scrubbing a param that is an array

## 0.5.3 [YANKED]
### Added
- Scrub fields from session params too (instead of just POST). Add `csrf_token` and `auth_token` to list of default scrub fields.

## [0.5.2] - 2013-04-02
### Fixed
- Fix compatibility issue with PHP 5.2.

## 0.5.1 [YANKED]
### Added
- Adding ability to write to rollbar-agent files

## 0.5.0 [YANKED]
### Changed
- Rename to "rollbar"

## 0.4.2 [YANKED]
#### Added
- Added new default scrub params

## [0.4.1] - 2013-01-22
#### Added
- Added optional `extra_data` param to `report_message()`

## 0.4.0 [YANKED]
### Fixed
- Error handler function (`report_php_error`) now always returns false, so that the default php error handler still runs. This is a breaking change if your code relied on the old behavior where the error handler did *not* ever halt script execution.
